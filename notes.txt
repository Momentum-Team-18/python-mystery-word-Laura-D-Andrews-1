Rules: 
Rules: 
1. 8 guesses allowed - remind user how many guesses they have left
2. A guess is only used if user guesses an incorrect letter
3. If same letter is guessed twice don't take away a guess
4. if guess letter twice - print a message letting them know they;ve guessed it twice
5. Game end - user guesses word or runs out of guesses
6. Word is revealed if user runs out of guesses 

Game flow: 
1. start - letter user know how many letters secret word contains
2. one guess per round - upper/lowercase doesn't matter
3. if puts in more than more letter - print message about invalid input
4. let user know if their guess appears
5. display partially guessed word and blanks for letters not yet guesses

Spicy additions: 
1. let user choose level of difficulty 
2. ask user if they want to play again at end
3. install colorama package to add colors to terminal 

Plan: break into individual parts
1. import - list of words
2. export - a guessing Game
3. create a read function to open and read file
4. display word - display blank letters of word - that changes when they guess letters correctly
4. need a way for user to input
7. a way to limit the number of guess 
8. tells if guess is wrong or right
9. function to choose a random word
10. prevent user from putting invalid input - more than one letter or invalid character, guess same letter twice 

word(letter for each position) with another list of _ _ _ ? Guess part is most important
prompting user and getting input
make list with # and word. Use random # selector

def play_game(filename)

word_list = file.read().split()
random_word = random.choice(word_list)
for word in random_word: 
display += ' _ '
print(display)

import random





 # display_nested_list = []
    # display_nested_list.append([*display])  # list looks like [[]]
    # display_letter_list = sum(display_nested_list, [])
    # print(display_letter_list)  
 # remove every 2nd element from list (because of space used in display, list was looking like [' ', '_', ' ']). So remove every space
    del display_letter_list[::2]
    print(display_letter_list)  # list now looks like ["_", "_", "_"]

    for index in range(len(letter_list)):
        print(index)
